## Exercise 1 - getting anything at all to work...
## This exercise shows a few points:
##
## - 1 - comments: any line starting with a '#' is a comment
## - python code is generally placed in files with the ending '.py'
## - unlike scratch, you have to type in code. If you get it wrong, it won't work
##     (but will give you a clue as to what it thinks is wrong)
## - it is meant to look a bit like english - eg 'print' will make it write something to the screen
##
## Press ctrl+F5 to make it run (in VSCode)

print ("Hello world")

## Try changing the above code:
## - add 2 numbers together
## - add 2 words together
## - add a number and a word together - read the error - what is the issue here?
